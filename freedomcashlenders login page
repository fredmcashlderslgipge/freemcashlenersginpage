The Dave app lets you borrow a small amount of money to cover expenses while you wait for your next paycheck or to avoid overdrawing your bank account. To be eligible for an advance, Dave users must open an ExtraCash account. The app also has a savings account and a “Side Hustle” feature that helps users find jobs to earn more money.
